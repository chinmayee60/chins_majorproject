Here's a two-part answer for Aphids:

1.  The best strategy involves thoroughly spraying affected plants with insecticidal soap or neem oil to smother and deter aphids, or using a strong jet of water to dislodge them.
2.  To support recovery, apply a balanced fertilizer with an emphasis on **potassium (potash)**, which enhances overall plant vigor, stress resistance, and strengthens cell walls.
