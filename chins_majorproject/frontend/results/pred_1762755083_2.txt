Since the cherry plant is healthy, there is no disease to cure; the best strategy is proactive cultural management, including proper sanitation, pruning for good air circulation, and regular monitoring to prevent future disease development. To support its continued health and vigor, a balanced fertilizer with adequate **potassium (potash)** is beneficial, as it enhances overall plant resilience, disease resistance, and fruit quality.
