Part 1: For aphids, the best strategy involves dislodging them with a strong jet of water, followed by applying insecticidal soap or neem oil to control persistent infestations.

Part 2: Potassium (or potash) is needed to support recovery, as it enhances overall plant vigor, strengthens cell walls, and improves the plant's natural resistance to stress and future pest attacks.
