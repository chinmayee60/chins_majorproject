**Part 1: Cure Strategy**
Applying a broad-spectrum systemic fungicide, particularly those containing triazoles (DMI) or strobilurins (QoI), is the most effective chemical cure strategy, especially when applied at early disease onset.

**Part 2: Recommended Nutrient**
Potassium (potash) is recommended to support recovery, as it enhances plant stress tolerance, strengthens cell walls, and improves overall disease resistance.
