Part 1: For organic control, apply insecticidal soap or neem oil directly to the aphids, ensuring thorough coverage, especially on undersides of leaves.

Part 2: Potassium (potash) is beneficial to support recovery, as it strengthens plant cell walls, improves overall plant vigor, and enhances resistance to stress and future pest attacks.
